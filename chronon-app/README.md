# chronon-app

Leptos operations UI for Chronon: jobs, runs, scripts, and dashboards under
`/chronon`.

```toml
# Pin tag or rev — do not use branch = "main".
chronon-app = { git = "https://github.com/unified-field-dev/chronon-uf-app", package = "chronon-app", rev = "REPLACE_WITH_PIN", default-features = false }
```

```rust,ignore
use chronon_app::ChrononRoutes;
use leptos_router::components::Routes;

view! {
    <Routes fallback=|| "not found">
        <ChrononRoutes />
    </Routes>
}
```

Crate-root rustdoc owns Organized-by-task, Owns / does not own, the route table,
and the Examples. Mapping helpers live in `chronon-backend`.

Compose into a host that supplies a Chronon coordinator and the auth/context
extractors the app expects. Enable `ssr` / `hydrate` to match your host. For Help
spotlight tours, enable `uf-integrations` `offering-help` (or `full`) and
call `chronon_app::ensure_help_steps_linked()`. The `e2e-lab` feature is for the
Playwright lab host only.
